\section{Past, Present and Future}

LE Robotics Pvt. Ltd. has been originally established as the \ac{rnd} division of its parent organization, Lanka Electronics (Pvt) Ltd. Lanka Electronics (Pvt) Ltd has been founded in 1993  by a group of graduates of the University of Moratuwa, the leading technical college in Sri Lanka. In 1993 they established their first electronic product manufacturing facility in the city of Minuwangoda and currently they own another manufacturing facility in Anuradhapura city.\\

Being a leading innovation company in Sri Lanka, Lanka Electronics (Pvt) Ltd has manufactured professional electronic devices for the Sri Lankan government and multinational companies such as \textit{Variosystems (Pvt) Ltd}. In chronological order, some of the professional electronic products they have manufactured so far are shown in Table \ref{table:pastproducts}. In addition to those, the company manufactures several consumer electronic products as well. TV antennas and Boosters are the mainstream consumer electronic products.

\begin{table}[h]

\chapter{Description of familiarization work carried out}
%2.4 of janiths report
\section{Projects Assignment}

Although the official internship period commenced on Tuesday $4^{th}$ of January in 2022, we had had our first meeting with the supervisor about a month prior to that. The meeting was conducted online through a video conferencing platform due to the Covid 19 situation in the country. Figure \ref{fig:firstmeet} shows a moment captured during the meeting.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	
	\fbox{
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/familiarization/projectplan}
	}
	\caption{First meeting with the supervisor to choose a project plan}
	\label{fig:firstmeet}
\end{figure}

In that meeting, our supervisor introduced the available projects that we can work on in our training period. He offered us two separate paths we can select to work during our internship period as described in Table \ref{table:familiarize}. Depending on our interests, we chose  `Plan A' to continue with and I selected the project related to \ac{cv}. In summary, that project was about engineering a \ac{cv} subsystem to integrate with an existing pick and place machine to pick objects from a moving conveyor belt.



\begin{table}[h]

		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\label{table:familiarize}
\end{table}

\section{Facility Familiarization}

LE Robotics Pvt. Ltd. is a fully featured \ac{rnd} facility located in Minuwangoda, Sri Lanka. Facility consists of most of the machinery required for industrial robot arm designing, including a \ac{cnc} machine, a Lathe machine, a Milling machine and various other machines. In addition to that facility has the resources for single side \ac{pcb} designing and testing. On the first day that we visited the facility, we were accompanied around it to see the various machines and electronic test instruments. Our supervisor gave brief descriptions about most of such tools and encouraged us to learn how to operate them in our free time.\\

\section{Introduction to Industrial Robot Arm Designing}

On the same day, Supervisor gave us an explanation about the evolution of already developed industrial robot arms that were described in the Section \ref{Services and Products}. The explanation included capabilities and drawbacks of each design as well as the advantages and disadvantages of incorporating third party technologies to manufacture them locally.\\

Then he explained the importance of manufacturing all the parts of an industrial robot arm within the facility rather than simply using the available parts. Because then the manufacturer has the full potential to customize any design to best fit to a given application. If the third party parts are used this customization capability is reduced drastically and we have to adjust our designs just to suit them rather than the application. Due to this reason, LE Robotics Pvt. Ltd. has taken a great initiative to manufacture different types of motors locally using the available materials and knowledge.

\section{Non-Disclosure Agreement}

Another important concept that the supervisor pointed out on the familiarization session was \ac{nda}. It is a legal contract or part of a
contract between at least two parties, that outlines confidential material, knowledge, or information that the parties wish to share with one another for certain purposes but wish to restrict access to\cite{nda}. An \ac{nda} document contains the details given below.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Definitions of the terms used in the document such as Confidential Information, Disclosing Party and Receiving Party.
	
	\item Rules and regulations related to Use, Disclose and Reproduce the shared confidential information.
	
	\item Actions to be taken in an event of breach of a term of the agreement mentioned in the previous point.
	
	\item Non-Competition Clause which emphasizes the requirement	of a written permission prior to	direct or indirect attempt to register	or use the Disclosing Party’s	confidential information, during the	term of the agreement and the expiry of the agreement.
	
	\item Governing Law which describes the way of interpreting the agreement.
	
	\item Confidentiality Period/ Termination which specifies the duration of time	that the agreement remains in	force, if its is not terminated earlier	in writing by mutual agreement.
\end{enumerate}


Since we were temporary employees of the company we did not have access to any of the trade secrets of LE Robotics Pvt. Ltd., such as hardware blueprints, software source codes and etc. Therefore, the supervisor mentioned that  there  was no requirement to sign an \ac{nda}. However, he explained the importance of obeying an \ac{nda} as a professional engineer.

\chapter{Project Work}
\label{Project Work}
By title, the project that I was assigned, was \textbf{\textit{Machine vision based Real-time Motion Planning for an Industrial Articulated Robot Arm}}. In simple words, it was a project related to an automatic pick and place machine which can be used to pick objects placed on a conveyor belt and pass them to the next stage of processing.\\

My contribution to that project was to develop the following three aspects of the system. 

\begin{enumerate}[I.]
	\item Development of an object detection framework
	
	\item Development of an application for camera calibration (referred as \textit{Camera Calibrator \ac{gui}} in this document)
	
	\item Development of an application to train an object classification model (referred as \textit{Classifier Trainer \ac{gui}} in this document)
	
\end{enumerate}

Subsequent sections explain the mentioned sub-projects that were undertaken by me during the industrial training period. Implementation details are not exposed in this report as it does not comply with professional engineering ethics.



\section{Development of an Object Detection Framework}
\label{Development of an Object Detection Framework}
The first project, that I was assigned as a trainee electronic engineer was related to the \ac{cv} field. In this project, an Object Detection Framework was developed to be deployed in an Automatic Pick and Place Machine. In a summary, the framework is capable of identifying \ac{roi}, detecting and classifying objects, and determining the location and orientation of objects with respect to a real-world coordinate system for grasping (picking). This section explains everything related to the development of that framework.


\subsection{Problem Definition}\label{Problem Definition}
Most of the robotic arms used in industrial environments operate in a pre-programmed cycle. When comes to the way a human does the same task is much different as the path planning for picking an object may change from cycle to cycle because of the perception obtained through human vision. \Ac{cv} is the technology and methods incorporated to mimic the human vision in order to gain insights into the operating environment of the robotics system.\\

When it comes to real-time object detection using \ac{cv}, there is an inevitable trade-off between the accuracy and the speed of the operation. This depends entirely on the used \ac{cv} algorithms and the computational power of the available hardware. If the robotic system/ arm in interest is not controlled through a dedicated industrial PC with adequate computational resources, the amount of resources that can be allocated to the \ac{cv} unit becomes limited.  This will eventually result in great delays (which is not desirable when it comes to real-time operations) to produce the required outputs by processing the acquired images through the associated camera.\\

Due to the limitations in the resources, the initial problem of real-time object detection on a moving conveyor was subdivided into three problems.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Case 1:} Detection of objects placed in a \textbf{\textit{static environment}} (no conveyor belt is associated). Picking and placing is carried out by the robot in the usual way.
	
	\item  \textbf{Case 2:} Detection of objects placed on a \textbf{\textit{non-continuous conveyor belt}}. The conveyor belt can be paused when objects are detected and picking and placing is carried out thereafter.
	
	\item \textbf{Case 3:} Detection of objects placed on a \textbf{\textit{continuously moving conveyor belt}}. Picking and placing happen while the conveyor is moving.
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Solution}
\label{cv_subsystem}
As the initial stage of the project, case 1 mentioned in Section \ref{Problem Definition} was developed. It consisted of developing a \ac{cv} subsystem for detecting \textbf{\textit{stationary objects}} placed in a \textbf{\textit{static environment}}. In this case, no conveyor belt is used and objects are placed in the \ac{fov} of the camera.\\

Figure \ref{fig:ioprocess} shows the interconnection between inputs and outputs of the developed system. Once the video stream from a camera is fed into the system, it is capable of,



\begin{enumerate}
	\item Determining the grasping location of an object in a real-world coordinate system. The centroid of the 2D view of the object was considered as the grasping location. 
	
	\item Determining the gripper's angle. Orientation of object with respect to the positive x direction of the same real-world coordinate system was used for this.
	
	\item  Determining the class/ type of the detected objects using a \ac{sift} and \ac{svm} based classification algorithm.
\end{enumerate}

and providing them to the main controller of the pick and place machine as requested by it.\\ 

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	
	\fbox{
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/system/ioprocess.eps}
	}
	\caption{Interconnection between inputs and outputs of the \ac{cv} subsystem}
	\label{fig:ioprocess}
\end{figure}



Figure \ref{fig:cvsubsys} depicts the interconnections between the existing robot controller and the newly developed computer vision subsystem. Outputs shown in Figure \ref{fig:ioprocess} are provided to the robot controller through a serial communication link built using an \ac{uart} circuitry. For transferring data to the Raspberry Pi from the working PC, \ac{sftp} over Wi-Fi technology was used.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	
	\fbox{

	}
	\caption{Interconnections between the existing robot controller and the \ac{cv} subsystem}
	\label{fig:cvsubsys}
\end{figure}

For the implementation of the prototype, third-party tools given below are used.\\

\begin{enumerate}[1.]
	\item \textbf{\ac{rpi} 3 B+ Single Board Computer (SBC)}\\
	\textit{Product brief:} Online available at \url{https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rpi3/raspberry-pi-3-b-plus-product-brief.pdf}.
	
	\item \textbf{Logitech C310 HD Webcam, 720p Video}\\
	\textit{Technical specifications:} Online available at \url{https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023464573-Logitech-HD-Webcam-C310-Technical-Specifications}.
	
	\item \textbf{OpenCV open source computer vision library stable release 4.4.0}\cite{opencv_library} \\
	\textit{Stable and development releases:} Online available at \url{https://github.com/opencv/opencv}; A pre-compiled version of this library, which is optimized for \ac{cv} and Deep Learning on Raspberry Pi was used.
	
	\item \textbf{Gordon's Arduino wiring-like WiringPi Library for the Raspberry Pi}\cite{wiringpi} \\
	\textit{Unofficial Mirror for WiringPi bindings:} Online available at \url{https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi}.
	
\end{enumerate}


During the operation of the pick and place robot, the developed object detection algorithm runs only inside the \ac{rpi}. However, for the operation of that algorithm, it requires the data shown in Table \ref{table:datafiles}. A Windows \ac{gui} was developed to generate those data and the `Description' column of Table \ref{table:datafiles} provides only a simple overview of that data . Subsequent sections explain the functionality and the working principles of the mentioned \ac{gui}, in detail.\\

\begin{table}[h]
	\captionsetup{font=sc, labelsep=newline}
	\centering
	\caption{ Data files required to run the object detection framework}
	\begin{tabular}{|p{0.3\linewidth}  |p{0.6\linewidth}  |}
		\hline
		\textbf{File Name} & \textbf{Description}\\\hline
		{\tt calibration\_data.xml} & This file includes camera calibration data. That is, intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the associated camera.\\ \hline
		{\tt objects\_data.xml} & This file includes object classification model's data. That is, the data required for the object classification (class names, trained support vector machines and etc.).\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\label{table:datafiles}
\end{table}





\section{Development of an Application for Camera Calibration}
\label{Development of an Application for Camera Calibration}
The second project, that I was assigned as a trainee electronic engineer was related to the \ac{se} field. In this project, a Windows \ac{gui} was developed to calibrate a given camera. In a summary, the application is capable of generating the required data, to remove the distortions of captured images and to transform 2D image points back to a given 3D real-world coordinate system with an accuracy of $\pm 0.5 ~mm$.

\subsection{Problem Definition}

The end goal of the \ac{cv} subsystem mentioned in the Section \ref{cv_subsystem} is to provide the location and orientation of the identified objects, with respect to a known real-world coordinate system. However, when an image is captured, the details about the depth of the object relative to the camera are lost due to the real world to image plane transformation (the forward projection \cite{hartley_zisserman_2004}) happens inside the camera. This operation is non-invertible.\\

There are several methods used in \ac{cv}  literature to back-project image plane coordinates to the real-world coordinate system. In this project, a method which uses a single calibrated camera and analytic geometry was implemented. It was observed that the back-projected coordinates are accurate at least to $\pm 0.5 ~mm$. As mentioned for this back-projection process, a \textit{calibrated camera} is required and the rest is engineering mathematics. Therefore, the actual problem to be solved was to calibrate the camera associated with the pick and place machine.



\subsection{Solution}
Camera Calibration refers to the extraction of various parameters related to the camera that will be used to capture the video stream/ images. These parameters are required when the back-projection is done. For the camera calibration, the method that uses an asymmetric chess board was used\cite{cam_calib:_nodate}. Because that method was really simple and could be implemented easily using the resources that were available in the facility. The process of camera calibration is given in the Appendix \ref{Camera Calibration}.\\

Once the camera calibration is done, we will be able to extract the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of a given camera. Those parameters can then be used for back-projection which was my problem at hand. Extracted intrinsic parameters which are specific to the  used  camera, do not depend on the image. Among those parameters, \textit{Camera Matrix} is what has the greatest important. \textit{Radial/ Tangential Distortions} have a minimal importance and therefore can be neglected. Extracted extrinsic parameters of the image shown in Figure \ref{fig:backprojectimage}  are specific for that image. If in any case, orientation or the place of the camera is altered, these must be recalculated in order to be used in the back-projection algorithm.\\
	
	
As mentioned previously ultimate goal of this sub project was to develop a \ac{gui} application for camera calibration. The process mentioned above was therefore implemented in {\tt C\#} programming language using `\textit{Visual Studio 2019}' software. For the implementation, the \textit{Emgu CV} library which is a cross platform \textit{.Net} wrapper to the OpenCV image processing library was also used. It allows OpenCV functions to be called from .NET compatible languages like {\tt C\#} and therefore make the software development process efficient. The developed \ac{gui} is shown in the Figure \ref{fig:calibgui}.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\fbox{
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/calib/gui}
	}
	\caption{Camera calibrator \ac{gui} for Windows}
	\label{fig:calibgui}
\end{figure}

Once the camera calibration is done, the software can also be used to send the file that includes the necessary data to the \ac{rpi}. For that the \ac{rpi} and the working \ac{pc} where the software is run,  must be connected to the same \ac{lan} over WiFi.


\section{Development of an Application to Train an Object Classification Model}
\label{Development of an Application to Train an Object Classification Model}
The third project, that I was assigned as a trainee electronic engineer was also related to the \ac{se} field. In this project, a Windows \ac{gui} was developed to train a \ac{ml} model which can be used classify set of pre-defined objects. In a summary, the application is capable of generating the required data, to classify identified objects by the object detection framework explained in the Section \ref{Development of an Object Detection Framework}. Figure \ref{fig:classification} shows how the object detection framework classifies objects with the help of object classification model.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\fbox{
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/odf/v3siftsvm}
	}
	\caption{Output of the object detection framework with object classification capability}
	\label{fig:classification}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Problem Definition}

One of the key aspects of an object detection framework is to classify the detected objects. Because, in order to effectively make use of the information of the detected objects, it is necessary to know the type/class of them. In \ac{cv} literature there are various methods to determine the class of a detected object. Accuracy as well as the speed of the predictions was a major concern when selecting a method, as the end product was supposed to use in an industrial environment. By considering all of such aspects it was decided to use an \ac{ml} model which is based on \ac{sift} features and \ac{svm}s.


\subsection{Solution}

Prior to deploy any \ac{ml} tool for predictions in any system, they must be trained for the target task by feeding it the necessary data. In literature this task is known as \textit{training an \ac{ml} model}. Similarly, in our case the object classification model must be trained prior to couple it with the object detection framework explained in the Section \ref{Development of an Object Detection Framework}. This training phase of the classification model is carried out using a Windows \ac{gui} application developed using Emgu CV (a cross platform .Net wrapper to the OpenCV image processing library) package\cite{emgucv}. Figure \ref{fig:classtrainer} depicts the layout of the designed Windows \ac{gui}.\\

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\fbox{
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/ml/classifiergui}
	}
	\caption{Classifier trainer GUI for Windows}
	\label{fig:classtrainer}
\end{figure}

Once the training is done, the software can also be used to test the accuracy of the prediction model to fine tune its performance. Ultimately, the file that includes the necessary data can also be sent to the \ac{rpi} using the same software. For that the \ac{rpi} and the working \ac{pc} where the software is run,  must be connected to the same \ac{lan} over WiFi.\\

When the model is trained on a set of object classes, we can keep using the model for classification as long as we do not introduce new objects classes to our object detection framework.In addition to that, \ac{svm}s were trained using the one-vs-all approach. Therefore, each object class has its own \ac{svm} which decides whether an object belongs to that class or not (a binary classification problem). Therefore, the calculated histogram of features, of a given \ac{roi} (an object) is passed through all of \ac{svm}s when deciding the class of an object. This improves the accuracy of predictions but sacrificing the time. Therefore, time it takes to run a single object detection routine will depend on two factors.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Number of non overlapping objects placed in the \ac{fov} of the camera: \textit{Higher the number of objects, longer the time object detection takes.}
	
	\item Number of classes of objects: \textit{Lesser the number of classes  shorter the time object detection takes.}
\end{enumerate}



%===========================================================================
\chapter{Hands-on experiences}

The entire six months period of my industrial training was full of hands-on experiences. It was an ideal combination of learning, unlearning and relearning. LE robotics Pvt. Ltd. had no experts in the \ac{cv} field during the time I was working there. Therefore, I had to learn most of the things related to my assigned projects by actually doing them. This made an ideal opportunity for me to learn various technologies really fast and with minimum supervision. 

\section{Resources for Self-Learning}

As I made a lot of design decisions on my own while doing the project, I had to extensively refer to various knowledge resources throughout my training period. This taught me the right skill set to identify reliable information sources among a lot of garbage on the internet. Following is a list of information sources that I used during my training.\\

\begin{itemize}
	\item Google Search

\subsection{Google Search}

\textbf{Website}: \url{https://www.google.com/}

Without any doubt, the starting point of exploring any information on internet was the \textit{Google Search}.  It is the search engine provided by Google. The power of modern google search is pretty amazing and it can quickly adapt to your search patterns. This lets it bring the most relevant information to the user. Therefore, using the correct terms during a search matters and the quality of retrieved information extensively depends on that.

\subsection{Stack Overflow}

\textbf{Website}: \url{https://stackoverflow.com/}

\textit{Stack Overflow} is a question and answer website for professional and enthusiast programmers. It features questions and answers on a wide range of topics in computer programming\cite{stackoverflow}. If you are not doing something really new that no one has ever done, there's a high probability of finding an answer to any question which you may come across. Stack Overflow is that rich of various solutions to fit exactly to your problem at hand.\\

Additionally, the number of \textit{Scores} an answer has obtained for a particular question is an ideal measure to estimate the the reliability of the answer. Moreover, answers can be easily linked in your documentations and source codes using their associated \textit{Share} links. Figure \ref{fig:stackof} depicts an answer to a question asked on the Stack Overflow platform. The actual answer is available at \url{https://stackoverflow.com/a/10230489/15939357}.

\subsection{OpenCV Documentations}

\textbf{Website}: \url{https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/}

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library: \url{http://opencv.org}) is an open-source library that includes several hundreds of computer vision algorithms. It also includes high quality documentation as well, for each module of the library. These documentation contains theoretical concepts and a vast amount of example code snippets. Such code snippets can be used to understand the way of using a particular function in a given application. 

\subsection{EmguCV Documentations}
\label{EmguCV Documentations}

\textbf{Website}: \url{https://www.emgu.com/wiki/index.php/Documentation}

EmguCV is a  cross platform .Net wrapper for the OpenCV image-processing library. It allows OpenCV functions to be called from .NET compatible programming languages like {\tt C\#}. The wrapper can run on Windows, Android, iOS, Mac OS and Linux. EmguCV also includes a rich documentation which explains usage of various functions and their interfaces. This documentation comes handy when it comes to Windows \ac{gui} development in {\tt C\#} using Visual Studio software.\\


\section{Usage of Open Source Software}

\subsection{Introduction}

\Ac{oss} is computer software that is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to use, study, change, and distribute the software and its source code to anyone and for any purpose\cite{oss}. The purpose may be either commercial or private use. Most of the time such \ac{oss} are developed in a collaborative manner through  online platforms such as \textit{GitHub (\url{https://github.com/})} and general public has the access to examine the source codes. Additionally, any potential developer can contribute to such open source technologies and number of contributors has no limit.


\subsection{Advantages}

During our internship, we were encouraged  to use open source technologies as much as possible inside our project implementations. Because it has a lot of advantages when it comes to \ac{rnd} field. Few of them are listed below.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Most of the open source software are free of charge and there is no need of purchasing a license to use the source codes.
	
	\item Since \ac{oss} are developed in collaborative manner through publicly available online platforms, software are highly optimized due to the diverse perspectives of their developers. 
	
	\item There are  well established community driven online platforms to sort out different problems that may encounter during project development. Most of the time answers to such problems are readily available.
	
	\item Due to the indefinite number of contributors, there is a rich set of documentations related to the software. This makes the production really efficient as there is no need of blindly experimenting with the software.

\end{itemize}

The EmguCV docs that were introduced in the Section \ref{EmguCV Documentations} contain much description about functions in its library.
However, EmguCV docs does not contain code examples. This was a challenge  that I faced during the development of the software which were explained in the Sections \ref{Development of an Application for Camera Calibration} and \ref{Development of an Application to Train an Object Classification Model}. This is where the power of open source technologies can be used. EmguCV's source codes are hosted and developed at \url{https://github.com/emgucv/emgucv}. Therefore, they can be accessed by anyone without any charge and can be used to understand the usage of available functions in various applications. Situation is the same for OpenCV and its source codes are hosted and developed at \url{https://github.com/opencv/opencv}.\\

In addition to that, each such repository contains a section named as \textit{Issues} with various modifications requests and questions raised by the community. This issues section can be a life saver when working with latest versions of the software, as most of the problems that may encounter when using the latest versions may not be answered anywhere else on the internet. Figure \ref{fig:issues} depicts the issues section of the OpenCV project repository.


\begin{figure}[h]

		\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/handson/issues}
	}
	\caption{Issues section of the OpenCV project repository}
	\label{fig:issues}
\end{figure}


\section{Usage of Modern Tools}

As described in the Section \ref{Project Work}, throughout my internship period I had to work with technologies related to \ac{cv} and \ac{se}. Therefore, I gained a lot experience of using various tools related to \ac{sdlc}. The tools I used can be classified into two categories depending on the area I used them. That classification is shown in the Table \ref{table:moderntools}.

\begin{table}[h]
	\captionsetup{font=sc, labelsep=newline}
	\centering
	\caption{Modern tools used during the development of the software}
	\begin{tabular}{|p{0.35\linewidth}  |p{0.35\linewidth}  |}

		\textbf{Windows \ac{gui} Development} & \textbf{Object Detection Framework Development}\\\hline
		Visual Studio 2019 & Visual Studio Code\\
		Git & Git\\
		& CMake\\		
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\label{table:moderntools}
\end{table}
\pagebreak
\subsection{Visual Studio 2019}

\textit{Visual Studio 2019} is simply an \ac{ide} owns and developed by Microsoft. It provides necessary facilities for computer programmers to develop software. It consists of a source code editor, build automation tools, debugger and many more features that an \ac{ide} should contain \cite{vs2019}. Figure \ref{fig:vs} shows an instance of the application.\\

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\fbox{
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/handson/vs}
	}
	\caption{``Visual Studio 2019'' \ac{ide}}
	\label{fig:vs}
\end{figure}

Visual Studio uses various Microsoft software development platforms to develop software. In my project I used what is known as \textit{Windows Forms} platform. It is a free and open-source \ac{gui} class library included as a part of Microsoft .NET Framework, providing a platform to write client applications for desktop, laptop, and tablet \ac{pc}s. An application developed using the Windows Forms platform is called as a \textit{Windows Forms Application}. These applications are event-driven applications which means they spends most of their time simply waiting for the user to do something, such as fill in a text box or click a button\cite{winforms}. The code for the applications developed by me were written in {\tt C\#} language.


\subsection{Visual Studio Code}

\textit{Visual Studio Code} is a lightweight \ac{oss}, which can be used to write/edit computer programs (source codes) efficiently. It is being developed by Microsoft with the help of thousands of other developers all over the world. It can run on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for a few programming languages and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages as well to customize it according to the needs of the developer. In short, this cool, powerful application is called as \textit{VS code} by the developers and Figure \ref{fig:vscode} shows an instance of the application.\\

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\fbox{
		\includegraphics[width=0.82\linewidth]{figures/handson/vscode}
	}
	\caption{``Visual Studio Code'' source code editor}
	\label{fig:vscode}
\end{figure}

During my internship, I used VS code extensively for the development of the object detection framework described in Section \ref{Development of an Object Detection Framework}. I developed that algorithm using {\tt C++} language and the VS code extension for {\tt C/C++} was absolutely a game changer during the implementation. Some of the fascinating features of the VS code is given below\cite{vscode}.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{IntelliSense}, which provides smart completions based on variable types, function definitions, and imported modules.
	
	\item Built-in debugger with breakpoints, call stacks, and interactive console features.
	
	\item Built-in version controlling services to keep track of every line of your code.
	
	\item Rich ecosystem of extensions for customization.
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Git}

If the project at hand is related to software development, \textit{Git} is a must-have tool that you should be aware of. The reason can be explained as follows. Imagine an application is being developed by you, and you have made it to a working and stable state. Now your client wants you to add a new feature to the existing application. However, you are uncertain whether the application would work after the addition of the requested feature. Therefore, you tend to make a copy of your stable source code and start working on that copy. Now all the changes are done related to the new feature and you have made it works somehow.\\

What if the client wants to make a few changes and test another new feature? You have to repeat the same cycle by copying the latest stable version of your application. Imagine, what would happen if your client requested you to update the application for 10 more features. You will end up having a bunch of copies of the previous versions and it becomes an absolute mess. As you have to remember what each copy does. This is where the amazing tool `git' comes into the picture. Its logo is shown in the Figure \ref{fig:git}.\\

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\fbox{
		\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{figures/handson/git}
	}
	\caption{ Logo for Git (introduced in 2012)\cite{gitlogo}}
	\label{fig:git}
\end{figure}

Git records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. Therefore, you only need to keep one project directory and there is no need of keeping several copies of the same application (folder). This can be seen as \textit{time travel through the history of a specific project/ file}. In this way, git allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more\cite{git}.


\subsection{CMake}

In my project, the software development of the object detection framework described in Section \ref{Development of an Object Detection Framework} was carried out on a Windows \ac{pc}. However, the final target platform to run that application was a \ac{rpi}, which has a Linux based \ac{os} named as \textit{Debian}. A software that is compiled for a  Windows \ac{os}, can not run on a Linux system. Therefore, a method to bridge this gap as well as to automate the software build process inside the \ac{rpi} was required. This is where, \textit{CMake} came into the picture. Its logo is shown in the Figure \ref{fig:cmake}.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\fbox{
		\includegraphics[width=0.3\linewidth]{figures/handson/cmake}
	}
	\caption{ Logo for CMake\cite{cmake}}
	\label{fig:cmake}
\end{figure}

CMake is a cross-platform, free and \ac{oss} for build automation, testing, packaging and installation of software by using a compiler-independent method. That is, CMake doesn't actually execute the build process; instead, it generates build files for other systems such as Linux or Windows. It supports directory hierarchies and applications that depend on multiple libraries\cite{cmakewiki}. In my projects CMake was used as a build automation tool for generating build files of the objects detection framework for \ac{rpi}'s \ac{os}.

\chapter{Soft Skills Development}

When it comes to the present corporate world, it is obvious that technical skills alone can not take anyone to greater heights in his career. A person must be a perfect combination of both technical and soft skills to grow in whatever field he is in. Learning a new technical skill is not a big deal with the advancements in technology as everything is available at the fingertip. However, mastering a soft skill is much harder and takes time as we have to deal with human beings to do so.\\

LE Robotics Pvt. Ltd. was absolutely an ideal place to improve existing soft skills as well as to learn a new set of soft skills. Given below is a few of them. Please note that they are not in any specific order. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Problem-solving
	\item Adaptability
	\item Time management		
	\item Interpersonal skills
	\item Professional work ethic
	\item Communication	
\end{itemize}

\section{Problem solving} 

Solving problems is an art that needs to be mastered by every engineer regardless of his field. Problem-solving skills that I have gained in the university as an engineering undergraduate were a massive help for me to tackle the project work explained in Section \ref{Project Work}. During my internship, I could sharpen those skills to suit to industrial level with the guidance of my supervisor.\\

Solving a problem includes several stages such as identifying and formulating the problem, researching the literature to find out available solutions and analyzing them, designing components of the system and validating their functionalities and etc. Before joining LE robotics Pvt. Ltd. I did not have much knowledge about researching the literature to find out potential solutions. All I used to do at the university was googling to find solutions from here and there and combine them to make one solution fit the problem at hand.\\

However, I could realise, that method fails when it comes to the industry. This is where my supervisor guided me towards conducting substantial literature research based on `\textit{Research Publications}' which exposed me to the world of `\textbf{Research}'. Research publications are published by academic institutes, research laboratories and other renowned companies such as Google, Microsoft and etc. Therefore, the information on those publications is well documented and validated which makes them an ideal information source. In addition to that, their reliability is also very high as the authors are professionals in their respective fields.



\section{Adaptability} 

Companies and working environments are different from one another. To get the most out of where you are, you need to effectively adapt to the current environment and its people. Inability to do so can lead to various problems within the work environment and you can lose interest in working there.\\

One of the main challenges that I faced during the internship was not having an expert in the field I worked in, to get any useful advice. Because my supervisor was only capable of setting an end goal and providing a high-level solution which can have tons of solutions in the \ac{cv} literature. Moreover, he had no idea about the complexity of some of the assigned tasks. Due to the gap between what we learn at university and practical problems that arise when it comes to an industrial-level implementation, I was having a difficult time there in the first few weeks.\\

To receive some advice regarding this situation, I contacted one of the lecturers at our university. He provided me with some potential tricks to get out of the situation while keeping everyone happy. The best of those was ``work, for yourself'', not for anyone else, not for the company but for you. Because if you get mad and do nothing due to not receiving enough support, you are the one who is going to be adversely affected by it in the end. Therefore, I worked for myself and could complete my assigned task very well with the provided resources at the end.  



\section{Time management} 

There are several actions that can be taken to manage one's time effectively.  Proper planning and organization of the assigned tasks depending on their priority are crucial when it comes to proper time management. Because, if you can not plan and organize the assigned tasks you can be easily overwhelmed by them. During my internship, time management was not a problem for me due to the experience I have gained at university regarding the proper management of the available time. Moreover, the knowledge of modern tools that I had, to get various jobs done was also a plus point. Because, lack of knowledge of the correct tool to use for a particular purpose, can waste your time.

\section{Professional work ethic}

\chapter{Conclusion: Own perspective of areas to be improved (of the whole training process including self)}


\begin{appendices}
	\chapter{Camera Calibration} \label{Camera Calibration}
	
	The important input data needed for calibration of the camera is a set of 3D real world points and the corresponding 2D coordinates of these points in the image. 3D points are called object points and 2D image points are called image points.
	
	\begin{enumerate}[I.]
		\item \textbf{2D Image Points:} These points can be easily found from the images. These image points are the locations where two black squares touch each other in chess board. Functions in OpenCV is used to extract those points\cite{cam_calib:_nodate}.
		
		\item \textbf{Object Points:}  For simplicity, the chess board was kept stationary at XY plane, (so Z=0 always) and camera was moved accordingly. This consideration helps us to find only X,Y values. Now for X,Y values, we can simply pass the points as (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (2,0,0), ... which denotes the location of points. In this case, the results we get will be in the scale of size of chess board square\cite{cam_calib:_nodate}. But if we know the square size, (for our implementation square size of the chess board was 30 mm), we can pass the values as (0,0,0), (30,0,0), (60,0,0).
	\end{enumerate}
	
	The process of camera calibration is given below.
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Keep the chess board stationary in the XY plane of the real world coordinate system as shown in the Figure \ref{fig:clib3dworld} and do not let it move due to any reason.
		
		\begin{figure}[h]
			\centering
			\fbox{
				\includegraphics[width=0.35\linewidth]{figures/calib/realworld}
			}
			\caption{Real world coordinate system and the position of the camera with respect to it. }
			\label{fig:clib3dworld}
		\end{figure}
		
		\item Capture about 10-15 images (higher the better) as shown in the Figure \ref{fig:rawimages} using the camera that will be used for object detection, in several distances and orientations.\\
		
		The actual number of required images is around 6. However, in some scenarios OpenCV is unable to detect the chess board pattern properly in every image. Two of such reasons are given below.
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item\textbf{Only a part of the chessboard is visible in the captured image}: For the program to work, whole chessboard must be visible in the captured image.
			
			\item \textbf{No proper lighting conditions}: if the environment that the  chessboard is placed, does not have proper lighting conditions application will not work as expected. Therefore make sure that the chessboard pattern receives enough light.
			
		\end{itemize}
		Hence, it's better to capture images more than the required amount so that we can filter out damaged/ useless images later. 
		
		\begin{figure}[h]
			\centering
			\fbox{
				\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/calib/rawImages}
			}
			\caption{Raw images captured by placing the camera in various distance and orientations}
			\label{fig:rawimages}
		\end{figure}
		
		\item Capture one additional special image, placing the camera in the place that it will be mounted when the actual object detection algorithm runs. Extrinsic parameters\cite{hartley_zisserman_2004} corresponding to this image will be directly used in our Back-projection algorithm.\\
		
		Extrinsic parameters contains a translation vector and a rotation matrix. These two together brings the calibration pattern from the object coordinate space (in which object points are specified) to the camera coordinate space. In more technical terms, the rotation matrix and translation vector performs a change of basis from object coordinate space to camera coordinate space. Due to its duality, it is equivalent to the position of the calibration pattern with respect to the camera coordinate space \cite{backproject:_nodate-1}.\\
		
		\begin{figure}[h]

			\fbox{		\subfigure[Raw image]
				{ \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{figures/calib/image36}
					
				}\hfill
				\subfigure[Processed image to identify the pattern]
				{ \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{figures/calib/image36proc}
					
			}}
			\caption{Captured special image to extract the extrinsic parameters that are useful for back-projection}
			\label{fig:backprojectimage}
		\end{figure}
		
		\item Use all of the captured images to calibrate the camera. The necessary documentation of the used functions are explained in \cite{backproject:_nodate-1}. After carrying out those functions you will be able to extract the extrinsic and intrinsic parameters related to the special image and the camera respectively.
