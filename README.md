> With the current global trends, Automation is becoming a key trend in business world as well as in day to day life. However, Sri Lanka in general is still catching up with these technological and life style advancements. 

> There is no argument that the Sri Lankan talent and capabilities in these technical areas can complete with the best in the world. And the potential growth to the Sri Lankan economy with development of local technical businesses would be crucial to make the next breakthrough in national development. But the opportunities available to the young talent to showcase their talent and capabilities are very rare especially since there are very few high-tech businesses in Sri Lanka.

> In order to provide the necessary encouragement and facilities to the young talent to shine in the technical field while fuelling the trend of new Sri Lankan technical businesses, LE Robotics embarked upon the challenge of designing and building robots in Sri Lanka to introduce industrial robots “Made in Sri Lanka”.
